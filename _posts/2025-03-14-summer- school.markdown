                <p>In the tradition of previous Data Science Africa events, a summer school on machine learning and data science will be held prior to the main workshop. The summer school is designed for graduate students, researchers, and professionals working with large-scale or unique datasets. This intensive program includes introductory and advanced lectures in data science and machine learning, alongside hands-on practical sessions. Participants will gain experience in data wrangling, data munging, and applying cutting-edge machine learning techniques to extract insights from data.

                </p><p>The DSA 2025 Summer School will involve end-to-end tutorial sessions from professionals walking the participants through both theoretical and practical aspects of data science and machine learning.

<ol>
    <li>Participants are expected to download, extract, and run the notebook. The notebook contains Python programming questions and hidden test cases.</li>
    <li>Upon the completion of the questions within the notebook, the participant should click on the download in the last notebook cell. By clicking on this cell, a zipped folder appears in the form DSA2024Test_XXXXX.zip. The characters after the DSA2024Test form the ZIP identification number for each submission. For example, if the downloaded zip is DSA2024Test_2024_02_15_T15_07_16_768034, then the Zip ID for the submission is 2024_02_15_T15_07_16_768034.</li>
    <li>The participant should then proceed to fill out the summer school form and enter the ZIP identification generated in step 2, along with other information.</li>
</ol>
